This was a fun project to reimplement 99 Bottles in a purely functional style after reading [99 Bottles](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/) by Sandi Metz and Katrina Owen

I wrote this in JavaScript using the [RamdaJS](https://ramdajs.com/) for no other reason than it was a teaching tool to introduce some FP concepts to coworkers. I'll likely implement a version in [SanctuaryJS](https://github.com/sanctuary-js/sanctuary) as well later.

To run:

`node main.js`
